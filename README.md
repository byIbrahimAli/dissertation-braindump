This is a part of my dissertation, a high-fidelity prototype of my app idea. It focuses on 2 features most voted by participants.

My app idea was to create a cross platform app which allows users to better express their emotions, avoiding the consequences from suppressed and repressed emotions. Users essentially use the app as an audio journal. The journals are then analysed to recommend relevant wellbeing articles to the user.

# Running the App

## Getting the mic to work
1. You'll have to enable mic permissions in the VM
2. Then go into Chrome and search using the Mic, this will prompt a mic permissions different to the previous step. Once you get that working, mic is set!
3. Go into the app, mic should be A-OK
